            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! Someone gave me this recipe a few years back, and it has become a household favorite. Depending on your taste, you can use mild, medium, or hot salsa. I usually serve it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.</p>

                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is tender and juicy and the juices run clear, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>

                    <li>Continue baking until cheese is melted and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes more.</li>
